# Plan for Car Detection Model Development and Deployment :-
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Gathering training data for the model that will predict the occurrence of cars ✅
2. Creating the training notebook using a pre-trained model -> ResNet50 ✅
3. Ensuring that the model is accurate ✅
4. Exporting the model and use it  ✅
5. Creating a script that will use the model to predict the occurrence of cars in real time ✅
6. Testing the script in real time and ensuring that it works ✅
7. Deploying the script to a server or edge device for real-time predictions ✅
8. Monitoring the performance of the model and making improvements as necessary ✅
9. Documenting the entire process and creating a user guide for the script ✅
10. Sharing the project on GitHub and promoting it to the community ✅
